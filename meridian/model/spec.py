  """Model specification parameters for Meridian.

  This class contains all model parameters that do not change between the runs
  of Meridian.

  Attributes:
    prior: A `PriorDistribution` object specifying the prior distribution of
      each set of model parameters. The distribution for a vector of parameters
      (for example, `alpha_m`) can be passed as either a scalar distribution or
      a vector distribution. If a scalar distribution is passed, it is broadcast
      to the actual shape of the parameter vector. Note that the
      `PriorDistribution` contains distributions for both `roi_m` and `beta_m`,
      but only one of these is used. If `use_roi_prior` is set to `True`, the
      `roi_m` prior is used. Otherwise, the `beta_m` prior is used.
    media_effects_dist: A string to specify the distribution of media random
      effects across geos. This attribute is not used with a national-level
      model. Allowed values: `'normal'` or `'log_normal'`. Default:
      `'log_normal'`.
    hill_before_adstock: A boolean indicating whether to apply the Hill function
      before the Adstock function, instead of the default order of Adstock
      before Hill. This argument does not apply to RF channels. Default:
      `False`.
    max_lag: An integer indicating the maximum number of lag periods (≥ `0`) to
      include in the Adstock calculation. Can also be set to `None`, which is
      equivalent to infinite max lag. Default: `8`.
    unique_sigma_for_each_geo: A boolean indicating whether to use a unique
      residual variance for each geo. If `False`, then a single residual
      variance is used for all geos. Default: `False`.
    use_roi_prior: A boolean indicating whether to use ROI priors and the prior
      on `roi_m` in the prior. If `False`, then the prior on `beta_m` in the
      prior is used. Default: `True`.
    roi_calibration_period: An optional boolean array of shape `(n_media_times,
      n_media_channels)` indicating the subset of `time` for media ROI
      calibration. If `None`, all times are used for media ROI calibration.
      Default: `None`.
    rf_roi_calibration_period: An optional boolean array of shape
      `(n_media_times, n_rf_channels)` indicating the subset of `time` for reach
      and frequency ROI calibration. If `None`, all times are used for media ROI
      calibration. Default: `None`.
    knots: An optional integer or list of integers indicating the knots used to
      estimate time effects. When `knots` is a list of integers, the knot
      locations are provided by that list. Zero corresponds to a knot at the
      first time period, one corresponds to a knot at the second time period,
      ..., and `(n_times - 1)` corresponds to a knot at the last time period).
      Typically, we recommend including knots at `0` and `(n_times - 1)`, but
      this is not required. When `knots` is an integer, then there are knots
      with locations equally spaced across the time periods, (including knots at
      zero and `(n_times - 1)`. When `knots` is` 1`, there is a single common
      regression coefficient used for all time periods. If `knots` is set to
      `None`, then the numbers of knots used is equal to the number of time
      periods in the case of a geo model. This is equivalent to each time period
      having its own regression coefficient. If `knots` is set to `None` in the
      case of a national model, then the number of knots used is `1`. Default:
      `None`.
    baseline_geo: An optional integer or a string for the baseline geo. The
      baseline geo is treated as the reference geo in the dummy encoding of
      geos. Non-baseline geos have a corresponding `tau_g` indicator variable,
      meaning that they have a higher prior variance than the baseline geo. When
      set to `None`, the geo with the biggest population is used as the
      baseline. Default: `None`.
    holdout_id: Optional boolean tensor of dimensions `(n_geos, n_times)` for a
      geo-level model or `(n_times,)` for a national model, indicating which
      observations are part of the holdout sample, which are excluded from the
      training sample. Only KPI data is excluded from the training sample. Media
      data is still included as it can affect Adstock for subsequent weeks. If
      "ROI priors" are used, such as `use_roi_prior=True`, then the `roi_m`
      parameters correspond to the ROI of all geos and times, even those in the
      holdout sample.
    control_population_scaling_id: An optional boolean tensor of dimension
      `(n_controls,)` indicating the control variables for which the control
      value will be scaled by population. If `None`, no control variables are
      scaled by population. Default: `None`.
    non_media_population_scaling_id: An optional boolean tensor of dimension
      `(n_non_media_channels,)` indicating the non-media variables for which the
      non-media value will be scaled by population. If `None`, then no non-media
      variables are scaled by population. Default: `None`.
