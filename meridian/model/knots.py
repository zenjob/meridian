  """Computes weights at knots for every time period.

  The two neighboring knots inform the estimate of a particular time period. The
  amount they inform the time period depends on how close (L1 distance) they
  are. If a time point coincides with a knot location, then 100% weight is
  given to that knot. If a time point lies outside the range of knots, then 100%
  weight is given to the nearest endpoint knot.

  This function computes an `(n_knots, n_times)` array of weights that are used
  to model trend and seasonality. For a given time, the array contains two
  non-zero weights. The weights are inversely proportional to the L1 distance
  from the given time to the neighboring knots. The two weights are normalized
  such that they sum to 1.

  Args:
    n_times: The number of time points.
    knot_locations: The location of knots within `0, 1, 2,..., (n_times-1)`.

  Returns:
