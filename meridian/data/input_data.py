@dataclasses.dataclass
class InputData:
  """A data container for advertising data in a format supported by Meridian.

  Attributes:
    kpi: A DataArray of dimensions `(n_geos, n_times)` containing the
      non-negative dependent variable. Typically this is the number of units
      sold, but it can be any metric, such as revenue or conversions.
    kpi_type: A string denoting whether the KPI is of a `'revenue'` or
      `'non-revenue'` type. When the `kpi_type` is `'non-revenue'` and
      `revenue_per_kpi` exists, ROI calibration is used and the analysis is run
      on revenue. When the `revenue_per_kpi` doesn't exist for the same
      `kpi_type`, custom ROI calibration is used and the analysis is run on KPI.
    controls: A DataArray of dimensions `(n_geos, n_times, n_controls)`
      containing control variable values.
    population: A DataArray of dimensions `(n_geos,)` containing the population
      of each group. This variable is used to scale the KPI and media for
      modeling.
    revenue_per_kpi: An optional DataArray of dimensions `(n_geos, n_times)`
      containing the average revenue amount per KPI unit. Although modeling is
      done on `kpi`, model analysis and optimization are done on `KPI *
      revenue_per_kpi` (revenue), if this value is available. If `kpi`
      corresponds to revenue, then an array of ones is passed automatically.
    media: An optional DataArray of dimensions `(n_geos, n_media_times,
      n_media_channels)` containing non-negative media execution values.
      Typically these are impressions, but it can be any metric, such as cost or
      clicks. `n_media_times` ≥ `n_times` is required, and the final `n_times`
      time periods must align with the time window of `kpi` and `controls`. Due
      to lagged effects, we recommend that the time window for media includes up
      to `max_lag` additional periods prior to this window. If `n_media_times` <
      `n_times` + `max_lag`, the model effectively imputes media history as zero
      (no media execution). If `n_media_times` > `n_times` + `max_lag`, then
      only the final `n_times` + `max_lag` periods are used to fit the model.
      `media` and `media_spend` must contain the same number of media channels
      in the same order. If either of these arguments is passed, then the other
      is not optional.
    media_spend: An optional `DataArray` containing the cost of each media
      channel. This is used as the denominator for ROI calculations. The
      DataArray shape can be `(n_geos, n_times, n_media_channels)` or
      `(n_media_channels,)` if the data is aggregated over `geo` and `time`
      dimensions. We recommend that the spend total aligns with the time window
      of the `kpi` and `controls` data, which is the time window over which
      incremental outcome of the ROI numerator is calculated. However, note that
      incremental outcome is influenced by media execution prior to this time
      window, through lagged effects, and excludes lagged effects beyond the
      time window of media executed during the time window. `media` and
      `media_spend` must contain the same number of media channels in the same
      order. If either of these arguments is passed, then the other is not
      optional.
    reach: An optional `DataArray` of dimensions `(n_geos, n_media_times,
      n_rf_channels)` containing non-negative `reach` values. It is required
      that `n_media_times` ≥ `n_times`, and the final `n_times` time periods
      must align with the time window of `kpi` and `controls`. The time window
      must include the time window of the `kpi` and `controls` data, but it is
      optional to include lagged time periods prior to the time window of the
      `kpi` and `controls` data. If lagged reach is not included, or if the
      lagged reach includes fewer than `max_lag` time periods, then the model
      calculates Adstock assuming that reach execution is zero prior to the
      first observed time period. We recommend including `n_times` + `max_lag`
      time periods, unless the value of `max_lag` is prohibitively large. If
      only `media` data is used, then `reach` will be `None`. `reach`,
      `frequency`, and `rf_spend` must contain the same number of media channels
      in the same order. If any of these arguments is passed, then the others
      are not optional.
    frequency: An optional `DataArray` of dimensions `(n_geos, n_media_times,
      n_rf_channels)` containing non-negative `frequency` values. It is required
      that `n_media_times` ≥ `n_times`, and the final `n_times` time periods
      must align with the time window of `kpi` and `controls`. The time window
      must include the time window of the `kpi` and `controls` data, but it is
      optional to include lagged time periods prior to the time window of the
      `kpi` and `controls` data. If lagged frequency is not included, or if the
      lagged frequency includes fewer than `max_lag` time periods, then the
      model calculates Adstock assuming that frequency execution is zero prior
      to the first observed time period. We recommend including `n_times` +
      `max_lag` time periods, unless the value of `max_lag` is prohibitively
      large. If only `media` data is used, then `frequency` will be `None`.
      `reach`, `frequency`, and `rf_spend` must contain the same number of media
      channels in the same order. If any of these arguments is passed, then the
      others are not optional.
    rf_spend: An optional `DataArray` containing the cost of each reach and
      frequency channel. This is used as the denominator for ROI calculations.
      The DataArray shape can be `(n_rf_channels,)`, `(n_geos, n_times,
      n_rf_channels)`, or `(n_geos, n_rf_channels)`. The spend should be
      aggregated over geo and/or time dimensions that are not represented. We
      recommend that the spend total aligns with the time window of the `kpi`
      and `controls` data, which is the time window over which incremental
      outcome of the ROI numerator is calculated. However, note that incremental
      outcome is influenced by media execution prior to this time window,
      through lagged effects, and excludes lagged effects beyond the time window
      of media executed during the time window. If only `media` data is used,
      `rf_spend` will be `None`. `reach`, `frequency`, and `rf_spend` must
      contain the same number of media channels in the same order. If any of
      these arguments is passed, then the others are not optional.
    organic_media: An optional `DataArray` of dimensions `(n_geos,
      n_media_times, n_organic_media_channels)` containing non-negative organic
      media values. Organic media variables are media activities that have no
      direct cost. These may include impressions from newsletters, a blog post,
      social media activity or email campaigns but it can be any metric, such as
      clicks. `n_media_times` ≥ `n_times` is required, and the final `n_times`
      time periods must align with the time window of `kpi` and `controls`. Due
      to lagged effects, we recommend that the time window for organic media
      includes up to `max_lag` additional periods prior to this window. If
      `n_organic_media_times` < `n_times` + `max_lag`, the model effectively
      imputes organic media history. If `n_organic_media_times` > `n_times` +
      `max_lag`, then only the final `n_times` + `max_lag` periods are used to
      fit the model.
    organic_reach: An optional `DataArray` of dimensions `(n_geos,
      n_media_times, n_organic_rf_channels)` containing non-negative organic
      reach values. It is required that `n_media_times` ≥ `n_times`, and the
      final `n_times` time periods must align with the time window of `kpi` and
      `controls`. The time window must include the time window of the `kpi` and
      `controls` data, but it is optional to include lagged time periods prior
      to the time window of the `kpi` and `controls` data. If lagged reach is
      not included, or if the lagged reach includes fewer than `max_lag` time
      periods, then the model calculates Adstock assuming that reach execution
      is zero prior to the first observed time period. We recommend including
      `n_times` + `max_lag` time periods, unless the value of `max_lag` is
      prohibitively large. If no organic reach and frequency data is used, then
      `organic_reach` and `organic_frequency` will be `None`. `organic_reach`,
      and `organic_frequency` must contain the same number of channels in the
      same order. If any of these arguments is passed, then the other is not
      optional.
    organic_frequency: An optional `DataArray` of dimensions `(n_geos,
      n_media_times, n_organic_rf_channels)` containing non-negative organic
      frequency values. It is required that `n_media_times` ≥ `n_times`, and the
      final `n_times` time periods must align with the time window of `kpi` and
      `controls`. The time window must include the time window of the `kpi` and
      `controls` data, but it is optional to include lagged time periods prior
      to the time window of the `kpi` and `controls` data. If lagged frequency
      is not included, or if the lagged frequency includes fewer than `max_lag`
      time periods, then the model calculates Adstock assuming that frequency
      execution is zero prior to the first observed time period. We recommend
      including `n_times` + `max_lag` time periods, unless the value of
      `max_lag` is prohibitively large. If no organic reach and frequency data
      is used, then `organic_frequency` will be `None`. `organic_reach` and
      `organic_frequency` must contain the same number of channels in the same
      order. If any of these arguments is passed, then the other is not
      optional.
    non_media_treatments: An optional DataArray of dimensions `(n_geos, n_times,
      n_non_media_channels)` containing non-media treatment variables values.
      Non-media treatment variables are marketing activities taken by the
      advertiser not directly related to media. They have no direct marketing
      cost associated with them but unlike organic media variables there are no
      Adstock and Hill effects. They differ from control variables as they are
      considered to be intervenable and hence are treatment variables under the
      causal model. Some examples include running a promotion, the price of a
      product and a change in a product's packaging and/or design.
